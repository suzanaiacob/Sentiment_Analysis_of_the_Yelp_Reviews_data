# sentiment_analysis_of_the_yelp_reviews_data
## NLP and Machine Learning project to classify the sentiment of reviews

This is one of my analytics projects (which I wrote when I applied to MIT) where I use descriptive analysis, NPL techniques (bag-of-words) and Machine Learning to process a large body of text in the form of Yelp reviews. I use classification trees for sentiment analysis to identify positive and negative reviews. Finally, I develop an approach for extracting the positive and negative features of a particular business (here a Las Vegas restaurant). The goal is to understand what customers like or dislike about a business by extracting meaningful insights from the reviews. 

The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset.

The code is in the R Jupyter Notebook **sentiment-analysis-of-the-yelp-reviews-data.ipynb** and a presentation of the results can be found in the file **Presentation - The Analytics of Customer Reviews.pdf**. 

Feel free to download the data and the notebook to see how the code runs!
